# Document Creation Requests

## Document Generation Process

1. **Initial Request**: Users initiate the document creation process by making a request.
2. **Swimm AI Response**: Swimm AI acknowledges the request and provides a brief introduction to the document generation process.
3. **Draft PR Generation**: Swimm AI generates a draft Pull Request (PR) with a placeholder for the document content. This PR is subsequently updated with the actual document content.
4. **Document Location**: The document content is updated in the respective PR, and a link to the PR is provided for user reference.

## Example
